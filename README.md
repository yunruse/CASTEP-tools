# CASTEP-tools

Tools used in an academic project for creating and analysing CASTEP tasks.

As this academic project is still ongoing, this repo is not yet open to contribution.

The project concentrates on methane-hydrogen mixtures, so some code may be specific.
I have endeavoured to make it generic where possible, however.
